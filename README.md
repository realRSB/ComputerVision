# 📌 Computer Vision Project

Welcome to the **ComputerVision** repository! This project focuses on leveraging **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for advanced computer vision applications, including hand tracking, face detection, and more. 🚀

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains various computer vision implementations utilizing:

- **OpenCV**: Image processing and real-time computer vision.
- **MediaPipe**: Pre-trained machine learning models for facial recognition, hand tracking, etc.
- **Python**: The core programming language for implementing models and processing image data.

## 🔧 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:realRSB/ComputerVision.git
cd ComputerVision
```

### **2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Use

Run the main script to start the computer vision pipeline:

```bash
python hand_tracking/hand_tracking.py
```

This will start real-time **hand tracking** using a webcam.
